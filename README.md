How Much Does a Law Firm Website Cost? (A Simple Guide)
=======================================================

Hey friend,

If you're running a law firm (or planning to start one), one of the best things you can do for your practice is to build a professional website. 

These days, when someone needs legal help, the first place they turn to is Google, not the yellow pages or a billboard. That’s why having a strong online presence isn’t optional anymore. It's essential.

But I get it — you’re probably wondering:

“How much does a law firm website cost?”

Let me break it down for you in simple English, just like I would if we were chatting over coffee. I’ll also share a solid shortcut that can save you money while still giving your firm a professional edge.

What Makes a Law Firm Website Different?
----------------------------------------

A law firm website isn’t just any website. It needs to do a few important things:

*   Build **trust** (people don’t hire lawyers they don’t trust)
    
*   Explain your **services clearly** (so people know how you can help)
    
*   Make it easy to **get in touch**
    
*   Show **proof** that you’re good at what you do (like testimonials, credentials, or case studies)
    

Most good law firm websites include:

*   A clean **Homepage**
    
*   An **About Us** page with your bio and qualifications
    
*   A clear **Services** or **Practice Areas** page
    
*   A **Contact** page with a form or booking option
    
*   Maybe a **Blog** to educate potential clients and improve SEO
    
*   Possibly a **Testimonials** or **Case Results** section
    

Now let’s talk money.

### **So, What’s the Cost?**

This is where the answers can get confusing, because the price range is all over the place.

### 💸 Low-End DIY Websites ($100–$300/year)

You could use website builders like Wix or Squarespace. These are okay for basic websites, but they come with limitations:

*   You’ll have to do everything yourself
    
*   It might look unprofessional or too simple for a law firm
    
*   You might end up spending hours learning how to set things up
    

For a law firm — where credibility really matters — this option usually isn’t ideal unless it’s just a temporary solution.

### 💼 Agencies & Legal Website Specialists ($2,000–$10,000+)

Many web design agencies — especially those that specialize in legal websites — charge several thousand dollars. 

Some even charge **ongoing monthly fees** for hosting, maintenance, and content updates.

You might get a beautiful site, but not every small firm has that kind of budget lying around, especially if you're just starting or trying to keep costs lean.

What’s the Middle Ground?
-------------------------

This is where a lot of lawyers (especially solo practitioners or small firms) get stuck. You want something professional, but you don’t want to spend $5,000+ just to get started.

That’s why I recommend checking out a web design agency called **ASBWDA** — short for [**Affordable Small Business Web Design Agency**](https://affordablesmallbusinesswebsitedesign.com/).

They’re not just affordable — they actually build **high-converting websites** designed to help businesses (including law firms) get clients.

For **$700 to $1,000**, they’ll build you a:

*   Clean, modern website tailored to your law firm
    
*   Mobile-friendly site (looks great on phones)
    
*   Fast-loading pages (important for SEO and first impressions)
    
*   Easy-to-navigate layout that builds trust
    
*   Contact forms that help you capture leads
    

And the best part? They take care of the tech stuff, so you don’t have to deal with confusing setup steps or spend hours figuring it out yourself.

What’s Included in That Price?
------------------------------

Here’s what you typically get with ASBWDA’s $700–$1,000 package:

*   Up to 5–7 pages (more than enough for most law firms)
    
*   Copywriting support, if you need help writing content
    
*   Speed and SEO optimization (so your site shows up better on Google)
    
*   Help with your domain name, hosting, and setup
    
*   Optional extras like testimonial sections or contact forms
    

No monthly subscription fees. No hidden upsells. Just a straightforward, professional website that works.

Why It Matters
--------------

A professional website for your law firm does more than just "look nice." It can:

*   Help you show up in search results
    
*   Build credibility with potential clients
    
*   Save you time by answering common questions online
    
*   Bring in leads while you sleep
    

You don’t need to spend thousands to have a site that does all that.

ASBWDA understands small businesses, and they know how to build websites that get results **without draining your bank account**.

### **Final Thoughts**

So, how much does a law firm website cost?

*   You could do it yourself for under $300/year, but it’ll take a lot of time and won’t look very professional
    
*   You could hire a big agency for $3,000–$10,000, but that’s a big investment, and often more than you actually need
    
*   Or you could go with a smart, affordable option like [**ASBWDA (click here)**](https://affordablesmallbusinesswebsitedesign.com/), and get a professional, high-performing site for just **$700–$1,000**
    

If you're ready to build trust, attract more clients, and look like the real deal online — without overpaying — I’d definitely recommend giving ASBWDA a look.
